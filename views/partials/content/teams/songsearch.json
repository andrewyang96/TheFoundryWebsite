I was hooked when I saw my first \"Hello World\" flickering in a terminal; I felt like the machine was dancing at my fingertips. I am most interested in artificial intelligence and would like to see my name on a patent for the first thinking, feeling man-made system. That, and I want to live comfortably on top of a fat paycheck.",
