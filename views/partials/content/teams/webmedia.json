Since then, the idea of building programs has captivated me. My earliest projects were games made with <a href=\"http://pygame.org/news.html\">Pygame</a>, a library for Python. They can still be found on my website. Now I am working with frameworks such as Node.js + Express.js and keeping up with the latest technologies.</p>",
