Living in \n Silicon Valley for my entire life, I've always been surrounded by technology, \n and always wanted to be a part of the world-changing culture. I am inspired \n by the fact that companies like Twitter and Facebook, have the power \n to bring people together and cause drastic change in the world; \n it is awe inspiring, and something I want to be a part of.  \n Through UIUC's Computer Science program, I hope to gain the knowledge in order to work \n in start ups, and eventually become a successful tech entrepreneur.",
